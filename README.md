Documentation of my custom PC build project showcasing hardware installation and troubleshooting skills.


This repository documents the process of building a custom PC, showcasing expertise in microcomputer hardware installation, troubleshooting, and optimization.

## Overview
This project focused on designing and assembling a high-performance custom PC optimized for gaming, video editing, and productivity tasks. Built with a powerful Intel Core i9-12900K CPU and GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, it delivers exceptional performance across demanding applications. The system also features 64GB of DDR5 RAM for seamless multitasking and an 8TB HDD, providing ample storage for large projects and data-intensive workflows. Additionally, careful attention was given to hardware compatibility, installation, and configuration, ensuring a smooth and efficient build process.

## **Components**
- **Case:** Phanteks NV5 Mid-Tower (High airflow, tempered glass, RGB)
- **Motherboard:** MSI Z790 GAMING PRO WIFI (LGA 1700, DDR5 support)
- **CPU:** Intel Core i9-12900K (16-core, Alder Lake, 3.2GHz base)
- **CPU Cooler:** be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5 (Air cooler, quiet operation, TDP 270W)
- **GPU:** GIGABYTE WINDFORCE GeForce RTX 4070 (12GB GDDR6X)
- **RAM:** G.SKILL Flare X Series 64GB (DDR5 6000MHz)
- **Storage:**
  - **Seagate BarraCuda 8TB HDD** (For mass storage)
  - *(Future upgrade planned: NVMe SSD for OS)*
- **PSU:** CORSAIR RM850e 850W 80+ Gold (Fully modular, PCIe 5.0 ready)
- **OS:** Microsoft Windows 11 Home

## **Assembly Process**
1. **Component Installation** - Installed motherboard, CPU, RAM, and GPU.
2. **Cooling Setup** - Mounted Dark Rock Pro 5 air cooler for optimal CPU temps.
3. **Cable Management** - Organized cables for a clean and efficient build.
4. **BIOS Configuration** - Updated firmware and optimized settings.
5. **OS Installation** - Installed Windows 11 and necessary drivers.
6. **Testing & Benchmarking** - Ensured stability with stress tests and benchmarks.

## **Performance Benchmarks**
*(To be updated once tested, including Cinebench, 3DMark, and gaming benchmarks.)*

## **Planned Future Upgrades**
- **NVMe SSD** for faster boot times and program loading.
- **144Hz+ 1440p Monitor** to match the RTX 4070's capabilities.
- **Better peripherals** (Mechanical keyboard, ergonomic mouse).

## **Lessons Learned**
- **Component compatibility is key** – Ensured all parts fit and worked together.
- **Cooling matters** – The Dark Rock Pro 5 keeps temps in check even under load.
- **BIOS tuning improves performance** – Adjusted power settings for efficiency.
